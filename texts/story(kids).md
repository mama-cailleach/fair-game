### Alright, little adventurers, gather 'round! Let me tell you a magical story about a brave wanderer, a tricky imposter, and a very important Fair Day in a sweet little town called Bo'ness.

## The Tired Traveler

Our story begins with you, a very special wanderer, who had walked a long, long way from Glasgow. Your feet were tired, and the sun was setting in the sky like a giant, sleepy orange. You saw a pretty town ahead, all lit up with the last bit of sunshine, and knew it was Bo'ness, ready for its big Fair Day tomorrow!
You didn't have a cozy bed for the night, but you found the biggest, most beautiful arch in town—the Queen's Arch! It was named after the kind Queen who had smiled at everyone that very day. "I'm sure she wouldn't mind if I snoozed here," you thought, snuggling into a secret spot where no one would see. You closed your eyes, not knowing your night was about to get a whole lot more exciting!

## A Secret in the Dark

But sleep didn't last long! In the quietest part of the night, when everyone else was dreaming, you heard something strange. A little clink and a whisper that tickled your ears. You peeked through a tiny crack in the arch, but it was too dark to see much. Still, your ears, which were extra good from all your travels, heard everything!
"The real Queen is hidden away!" a grumpy voice growled. "She's safe in the big, old, locked room at the abandoned mansion!"
Then, a slithery voice added, "Tomorrow, our pretend Queen will wear the crown! And then Bo'ness will be ours! Soon, the shadows from the south will creep in, and this happy town will be gone forever!"

Oh dear! Your heart went thump-thump-thump! A pretend Queen? And a whole town in danger? You had stumbled upon a big, bad secret that needed to be stopped!

## The Pretend Queen's Parade

When morning came, the town was wide awake and super excited! The happy sound of bagpipes filled the air, like a giant, musical yawn. From your secret spot, you watched as the Fair Day started. Laughter and yummy smells of fresh bread floated all around.
And then, there she was: the Queen! But you knew it wasn't the real Queen. It was the pretend Queen! She smiled and waved, but her eyes looked a bit cold, and her smile didn't quite reach them. Nobody else seemed to notice, because they were all so excited for the fair. But you saw the tiny differences, like spotting a sneaky fox in a field of sheep.
You looked at the people walking with her. Was it the shiny Champion? Or maybe the people carrying the scepter and crown? You knew someone important was helping the bad guys. You stayed hidden, letting the happy noise wash over you. The fair was full of bright arches and joyful music, and everyone was heading to the Town Hall for the crowning. You knew you had to do something, and fast!
Meeting the Witches
You decided to find out more. You tiptoed through the bustling fair, listening carefully. You chatted with flower girls, who giggled that the Queen had been a bit grumpy that morning. You talked to other friendly townspeople who told you all about the Fair Day's old traditions. Every chat made you realize there wasn't much time left!
Then, you saw a group of wonderful women getting ready for a special performance. They were the Witches of Bo'ness, known for their magical dances and clever songs! You felt a special tingle, a feeling you knew well, because you were a witch too! You had actually come to Bo'ness to find a secret, old place called the Witches' Stone.
As you chatted with the friendly witches, you all became fast friends. One kind witch, who was a special friend to the real Queen, leaned in and whispered, "The Queen seemed... different today, not herself at all." This was your chance! You leaned in too, and whispered, "Don't trust the Champion!" Her eyes grew wide! She quickly handed you an old, crinkly map. "This will lead you to the Witches' Stone, dear friend. Be careful!" she said.
The Spooky House and the Magic Stone
You thanked her and quickly looked at the map. Next to the Witches' Stone, you saw another name: Carriden House. A shiver ran down your spine. This was it! This was why you were truly meant to be in Bo'ness!
You hurried away from the noisy fair, following the map down a twisty, old path. Soon, you saw a big, abandoned mansion, all dark windows and broken bits, like a sleeping monster made of stone. You found a way inside, but it was so dusty and cluttered with old things, it was hard to move!
Deep inside the spooky house, you found a giant, heavy door. It was locked tight! You pushed and pulled, but it wouldn't budge. Then, you heard a tiny, muffled sound from inside—a soft cry, like someone was tied up. It had to be the real Queen!
But your wiggling and giggling had woken something else! A sudden, cold WHOOSH made you jump! You saw a sparkly, see-through shape—a ghostly knight! It was guarding the door! It pushed you away, and you quickly scrambled out of the house, your heart doing a wild dance in your chest.
You ran and ran until you tripped over a big, mossy rock. You looked down. It was a tall, jagged stone, half-hidden by plants. This was the Witches' Stone!

## Help from Ancient Friends

You caught your breath and thought hard. You couldn't fight a ghost by yourself, but you knew some very wise helpers! You performed a little ritual, just like the witches had taught you. Swirly smoke floated up, and the air felt tingly. Slowly, five shimmering figures appeared: Margaret Pringle, Bessie Vickar, Annaple Thomsone, and two friends both named Margaret Hamilton! They were the ancient witches of Bo'ness, here to help!
"The ghost knight is sad and lonely," whispered Margaret Pringle. "To beat him, you need his shiny sword. It's special, and it will open the door!" Bessie Vickar added, "And inside that room, beyond the knight, are our magical flying brooms! They've been waiting for a hero like you to carry you back to the coronation!"
The Queen's Great Escape
Feeling brave, you went back to the spooky Carriden House. You found the ghostly knight, and this time, you were ready! You used your own clever magic and what the ancient witches taught you. Maybe you made a bright light, or tickled his arm until he dropped his sword! However you did it, you bravely faced the knight, and its sparkly form faded away. You picked up its ancient blade.
The sword felt warm and buzzy in your hand. You touched it to the big, locked door, and click! The door swung open! Inside, tied up but safe, was the real Queen!
Her eyes, a little tired but full of thanks, sparkled at you. "Thank you, thank you!" she whispered. "We must hurry! The bad guys are from Linlithgow, and they want to steal Bo'ness and send all its people away!"
You spotted some beautiful, shiny brooms in the corner. "Look!" you said, a big smile on your face. "They're waiting for us!" With the Queen holding on tight, you both jumped on a broom and zoomed into the sky!

### A Coronation Saved!

Down below, Bo'ness was still bursting with Fair Day fun! Pipers played and crowds cheered, singing a happy song called "Festal Day." They had no idea their town was in danger! You and the Queen flew closer and closer to the Town Hall.
You arrived just as the pretend Queen's big, tough Champion was shouting, "If anyone says our Queen isn't real, I'll fight them!"
Everyone went quiet. This was your moment! You landed super softly, and the Queen quickly hid behind you. You stepped forward, your cloak swirling, and shouted, "I challenge you!"
The Champion laughed a big, booming laugh. "You? A simple wanderer? A witch thinks she can fight me?"
But then, a strong, clear voice rang out! The true Queen stepped forward, looking very grand and brave. "I am the Queen! That one, on my throne, is a trickster!"
Oh my, what a hullabaloo! The pretend Queen shrieked and leaped at the real Queen, a shiny dagger in her hand! And the Champion charged right at you!
Two fights broke out! The true Queen, surprisingly speedy, bravely fought the imposter. And you, with your clever witchy magic, were too much for the big Champion! Both bad guys were quickly defeated! Just then, the Witches of Bo'ness, who had been dancing nearby, did a special spell. Swirly magic surrounded the pretend Queen, and poof! Her disguise faded, showing she was really the mean Princess of Linlithgow!
With their sneaky plan ruined, the Princess and the Champion scrambled away, running into the crowd and disappearing. The real Queen watched them go, her eyes steady. "Let them run. They'll try again, but they'll never, ever take our town!"

### Happy Ever After in Bo'ness

The cheers that filled the air then were the loudest, happiest cheers ever! Not just for the Fair Day, but for their Queen, for their freedom, and for you, the brave hero who saved them! The true Queen was crowned with lots of claps and happy tears. The "Festal Day" song was sung even louder, full of joy and victory!
As the big parade went to Dougie Park for more fun, you were with your new witch friends, all of you smiling and laughing. You, the wanderer, the secret witch, the unexpected hero, partied with them, no longer an outsider, but a special part of Bo'ness's happy story. The air was filled with music, laughter, and the promise of many more happy Fair Days, all thanks to your courage and cleverness!
