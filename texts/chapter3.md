You looked at the map. 
Next to the Witches' Stone, you saw another name: Carriden House. 
A shiver ran down your spine. This was it! 
This was why you were truly meant to be in Bo'ness!

You hurried away from the noisy fair, following the map down a twisty, old path. 
Soon, you saw a big, abandoned mansion, all dark windows and broken bits.
Like a sleeping monster made of stone. 
Try to find the way inside? Yes/NO

IF yes > maze Then

You found a way inside, but it was so dusty and cluttered with old things. 
It is hard to move!
Deep inside the spooky house, you find a giant, heavy door. 

***
Try to open? = It is locked tight! 
*** 

Then, you heard a tiny, muffled sound from inside.
A soft cry, like someone was tied up. 
It had to be the real Queen!

***
Try to open = You pushed and pulled, but it wouldn't budge.
***

Your wiggling and giggling had woken something else! 
A sudden, cold WHOOSH made you jump! You saw a sparkly, see-through shape—a ghostly knight! 
It was guarding the door! It pushed you away!
and you quickly scrambled out of the house, your heart doing a wild dance in your chest.

You ran and ran until you tripped over a big, mossy rock. 
You looked down. It was a tall, jagged stone, half-hidden by plants. 
This was the Witches' Stone!
