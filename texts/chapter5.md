### A Coronation Saved!

(flying broom minigame hp1 style)

Down below, Bo'ness was still bursting with Fair Day fun! 
Pipers played and crowds cheered, singing a happy song called "Festal Day." 
They had no idea their town was in danger! 
You and the Queen flew closer and closer to the Town Hall.


You arrived just as the pretend Queen's Champion was delivering it's speech, 
"If anyone says our Queen isn't real, I'll fight them!" (the actual thing the champion says)

Everyone went quiet. This was your moment! 
You landed super softly, and the Queen quickly hid behind you. 
You stepped forward, your cloak swirling, and shouted, "I challenge you!"
The Champion laughed a big, booming laugh. "You? A simple wanderer? A witch thinks she can fight me?"


But then, a strong, clear voice rang out! The true Queen stepped forward, 
looking very grand and brave. "I am the Queen! That one, on my throne, is a trickster!"
Oh my, what a hullabaloo! The pretend Queen shrieked and leaped at the real Queen, 
a shiny dagger in her hand! And the Champion charged right at you!

(Fighting mini game? pokemon/jrpg style?)

Two fights broke out! The true Queen, surprisingly speedy, bravely fought the imposter. 
And you, with your clever witchy magic, were too much for the big Champion! 
Both bad guys were quickly defeated! Just then, the Witches of Bo'ness, 
who had been dancing nearby, did a special spell. 

Swirly magic surrounded the pretend Queen, and poof! 
Her disguise faded, showing she was really the mean Princess of Linlithgow!
With their sneaky plan ruined, the Princess and the Champion 
scrambled away, running into the crowd and disappearing. 

The real Queen watched them go, her eyes steady. 
"Let them run. They'll try again, but they'll never, ever take our town!"
