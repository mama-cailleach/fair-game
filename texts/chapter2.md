When morning came, the town was wide awake and super excited! 
The happy sound of bagpipes filled the air, like a giant, musical yawn.
From your secret spot, you watched as the Fair Day started. Laughter all around.
And then, there she was: the Queen! But you knew it wasn't the real Queen. 


It was the pretend Queen! She smiled and waved, but her eyes looked a bit cold.
Nobody else seemed to notice, because they were all so excited for the fair. 
But you saw the tiny differences, like spotting a sneaky fox in a field of sheep.
You looked at the people walking with her. Who was there with her the night before?


Was it her shiny Champion? Or maybe the people carrying the scepter and crown? 
You knew someone important was part of the night before. 
You stayed hidden, letting the happy noise wash over you. 
The day was bright and jolly, everyone was heading to the Town Hall for the crowning.

You decided to find out more. You tiptoed through the bustling fair, listening carefully. 
You chatted with flower girls, who giggled that the Queen had been a bit grumpy that morning. 
You talked to other friendly faerie people who told you all about the Fair Day's old traditions. 
Every chat made you realize there wasn't much time left!

"Friendly faerie people who seemed untrusting of the Champion. ",
"Every step made you realize there wasn't much time left!",



You look out at the parade, your eyes darting through the happy crowds, ~
searching for someone who might hold the first clue.

First, you spot a group of flower girls, giggling and gossiping among themselves. 
The Queen has just dismissed them, and they seem a bit annoyed, but also excited to be sharing a secret. 
They look like they know something important.

Just then, a few small faeries flicker by, their wings shimmering. 
They look at the Queen but do not approach her. You notice the Champion seems to be keeping them away, 
but the faeries don't fight it. They just exchange knowing glances with each other, 
as if they have a task of their own.

A little further away, a group of witches watches the parade from a distance. 
They are separate from the main crowd, but they seem happy and at peace. 
They feel like the right people to talk to, like they might understand your quest 
in a way no one else would.




Flower girls choices:
Did you notice some thing different about the queen?
Hi it's my first day here, I was travelling over night
where are you going to?



"She was so odd! Not at all like she was yesterday!"

"I don't know what bug bit her, but she looked so grumpy."

"She was so quick to send us away...it was kind of rude."

"I heard her dress wasn't even the right shade of Fair Day blue!"


"Oh, are you new? It's the best day ever!"

"We're parading to the Town Hall, then we'll sing and prepare for the crowning."

"The Queen gets her crown, and then we all dance and have fun!"

"There's going to be a big dance and a special present for the Queen."



Faerie choices.
Hi, did you notice anything odd today?
What was that with the champion all about?
How much time do I have they the crowning.
