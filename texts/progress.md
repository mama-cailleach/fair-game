# Weans Game Jam 2025 - Progress Tracker

## Initial Setup (August 2025)

	- Key stats: Wit, Perception, Spirit.
	- Story and scenes broken down into chapters for easy development.
- Copilot instructions and project guidelines created in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/pre_copilot.md` to ensure all code and content is child-appropriate and easy to extend.
